Data files are pieces of content that donâ€™t belong to a specific page or piece of content. They are commonly used for managing content like social media handles and links, contact information, and branding (e.g, logo images and site colours).

Forestry allows you to edit existing data files. They can be found under _Data_ in the sidebar.

## Customizing Fields

You can also apply [Front Matter Templates](/docs/settings/front-matter-templates/#applying-fmts-to-content) to your data files, allowing configuration of the fields that are displayed in the CMS. To do so, navigate to the Data File you want to customize:

1. Click the settings button in the top right, next to the "Save" button
2. Click "Change Template"
3. Choose the Front Matter Template you want and click "Done"

**Jekyll users:**

In order to use Front Matter Templates with data files, you will need to place all of your fields inside of a [Field Group](/docs/settings/fields/field-group/) with the same name as the name of your data file. 

For example, if you want to create a FMT for a data file named `social.yml`, you will need to place your fields in a Field Group with the name of `social`:

```
fields:
- type: field_group
  name: social
  label: Social
  fields:
  - type: text
    name: twitter_url
    label: Twitter URL
  - type: text
    name: facebook_url
    label: Facebook URL
```

This will be improved in a future update.
