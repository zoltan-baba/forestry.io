A Guest is a single-site user with limited permissions. Guests do not get access to support and are often used for clients or external colleagues.

A Guest can only access the site that you invite them to, whereas your _team_ (available to those on the [Business Plan](https://forestry.io/pricing/)) can access all of your sites. 

Each site can have up to 3 Guest accounts. 

For more information on managing Guests, see [Team Management](/docs/settings/team-management/).
