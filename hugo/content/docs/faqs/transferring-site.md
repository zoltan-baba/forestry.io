Navigate to a site on your Dashboard (e.g. "My Sites"). Click on the "..." next to a site and select "Transfer Site" in the dropdown. On the next screen you can choose between "My sites" or an "Organization".

If you selected "Organization", you'll be able to choose the destination from the dropdown menu, once you made your decision click on "Transfer".

You can only transfer sites to Organizations if your role for that Organization permits it. See [user roles](/docs/settings/team-management/#user-roles)
